# Solutions for CSES problems set

The problems set can be found at the following link:  
[CSES Prolems set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)

## Note on the solutions
- The solution of "Introduction/Grid Path" has some weird optimizations.
- I don't really understand the solution of "Graph Algorithms/Mail Delivery"
and "Graph Algorithms/Teleporters Path".
- I took the formula of "Mathematics/Sum of Divisors" from OEIS.
- I copied the solution to "Mathematics/Christmas Party" from Wiliam Lin CSES
stream.
- "Mathematics/Counting Necklaces" is not AC yet.
- I use Booth's algorithm in "String Algorithms/Minimal Rotation" and i don't
really understand the algorithm itself.
